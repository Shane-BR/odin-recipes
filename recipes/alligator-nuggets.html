    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried alligator nuggets don't get any easier than this and they are restaurant-quality.</p>
    <p>Serve with cocktail sauce, Sriracha, mayo, whole grain mustard, or any dipping sauce you choose.</p>
    <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 10 Mins</p>
    <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 10 Mins </p>
    <p><strong>Total Time:</strong> 20 Mins</p>
    <p><strong>Servings:</strong> 4 Servings</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5 ounces seasoned crispy fish fry seafood breading mix</li>
        <li>1 pound Louisiana alligator prime filet, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pour fish fry mix into a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag. Add alligator nuggets, reseal the bag, and shake to coat. Let stand for 5 minutes. Shake the bag again. </li>
        <li>Place half of seasoned alligator nuggets in the deep fryer. Cook until golden brown and nuggets float to the top of the oil, about 3 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Using tongs, transfer nuggets to a paper-towel lined plate. </li>
        <li>Repeat Step 3 with remaining nuggets. Serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
