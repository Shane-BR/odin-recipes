This marks the first of many projects I will be completing for The Odin Project.

This project demonstrates my almost adequate adeptness in creating web pages using HTML.
With the skills taught to me up until now I have mastered the basics of HTML, linking between pages, and even incorporating images!

The future seems ever brighter.
